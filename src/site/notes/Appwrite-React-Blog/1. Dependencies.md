## env var we need for this project

```
VITE_APPWRITE_URL=""
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=""
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=""
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=""
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=""
```

> [!question]
> why we use VITE  prefix before any var name in .env?
> the reason is if we use `VITE` prefix before the var name in env then only vite compiler will allow me to access it without it the if u try to get the env var it will show access denied
> in react we get the env var in any file by `process.env.varname` 
> but in vite this method dosent work we need to write `import.meta.env.varname`

**Types:**
- **Positive Value** → Similar nodes tend to connect (e.g., managers with managers).
- **Negative Value** → Dissimilar nodes tend to connect (e.g., managers with staff).
    

**Application:**  
Used to see if people collaborate more within their own department or across departments.

---
### 🔹 **2. Graph Similarity**
- **Graph similarity** compares the **structure** of two different networks (graphs) to see how **alike** they are.
- It checks if the same communication or workflow patterns exist across different teams or time periods.
    

**Methods of Comparison:**

- Comparing **number of nodes and edges**
    
- Checking **node centralities**
    
- Using **graph edit distance** or **subgraph matching**
    

**Application:**

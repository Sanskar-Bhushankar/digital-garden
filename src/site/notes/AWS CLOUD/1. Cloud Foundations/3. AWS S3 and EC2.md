### 1. **What is Amazon S3?**

- Managed cloud storage service by AWS, storing data as objects in buckets.
- Objects can be any file (documents, images, videos), each with a unique **object key**.
- Designed for **99.999999999% durability** (11 9s).
==This extremely high durability means that if you store **10 million objects**, you can expect to lose **one object every 10,000 years** on average.==
- Virtually unlimited storage; each object can be up to **5 TB**.

### 2. **Key Features**

- **Private by default**: Data privacy controlled through access permissions.
- Stores data **redundantly across multiple facilities**.
- Access data from anywhere via **HTTP/HTTPS**.
- **Globally unique bucket names**.
- Integration with AWS services, accessed through:
    - AWS Management Console
    - AWS CLI
    - AWS SDKs
    - REST API endpoints
- The Bucket names should be unique 

### 3. **Amazon S3 Storage Classes**

- **Amazon S3 Standard**: General-purpose storage for frequently accessed data.
- **Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Auto-moves data to lower-cost tiers when access drops.
- **Amazon S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)**: For less frequently accessed but readily available data.
- **Amazon S3 One Zone-IA**: Low-cost, single-AZ storage for infrequent data access.
- **Amazon S3 Glacier**: Affordable data archiving with variable retrieval times.
- **Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: Lowest-cost storage for long-term data retention with 12-hour retrieval.

| S3 Glacier              | 11 9s      | Not stated   | Long-term archival, flexible access       | $ (cheap)    | Minutes to hours | Retrieval fees, options for expedited access |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive | 11 9s      | Not stated   | Rarely accessed, very long-term retention | $ (cheapest) | Hours to days    | Retrieval fees, lowest-cost storage          |
### 4. **Access & URLs**

- **Data Access Methods**: AWS Console, CLI, SDKs, REST endpoints.
- **URL Structure**:
    - Format: `https://[bucket name].s3.[region].amazonaws.com/[object key]`
    - Example: Bucket in Tokyo region:
        - URL: `https://my-bucket.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/my-object.jpg`
- URLs are Region-specific, ensuring data locality.

### 5. **Data Redundancy & Durability**

- Data stored **across multiple facilities** in the selected Region.
- Built to **withstand loss of two facilities** without data loss.

### 6. **Scaling & Performance**

- **Auto-scales** to accommodate data growth.
- No provisioning of storage or throughput required.
- Charges based on usage.

### 7. **Common Use Cases**

- **Application Assets Storage**: Common storage for application files.
- **Static Web Hosting**: Host static websites with HTML, CSS, JS.
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Reliable backup storage with high durability.
- **Big Data Analytics**: Scalable storage for big data workflows.

### 8. **Amazon S3 Pricing**

- Pricing based on:
    - **Storage Usage**: Cost per GB per month for each storage class.
    - **Data Transfer**: Charges for data transfer out of AWS Regions.
    - **Operations**: PUT, GET, LIST, and COPY operations.
- **Free of Charge**:
    - Data transferred into Amazon S3.
    - Transfers out to CloudFront or EC2 within the same Region.

### 9. **Cost Factors**

- **Storage Class**: Costs differ for Standard, IA, Glacier, etc.
- **Amount of Data**: Number and size of stored objects.
- **Request Types**: Charges for API operations like GET, PUT, COPY.
- **Data Transfer**: Free inbound; charges for outbound to different Regions.

# EC2 (Elastic compute cloud)

- **Cloud VMs**: Virtual machines (EC2 instances) in the AWS Cloud for scalable computing.
- **Guest OS Control**: Full control over Windows or Linux operating systems.
- **Elastic Scaling**: Easily scale the number and size of instances to meet demand.
- **Quick Deployment**: Launch instances quickly from AMIs across global regions.
- **Traffic Management**: Use security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **EC2 = IaaS**: Provides complete control over OS and infrastructure (Infrastructure as a Service).

### **AWS Compute Categories**

- **VMs**: EC2 and Lightsail provide virtual servers.
- **Containers**: Amazon ECS for Docker containers, Fargate for serverless containers.
- **PaaS**: Elastic Beanstalk simplifies app deployment without managing infrastructure.
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda runs code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Specialized**: AWS Outposts for on-premises infrastructure, AWS Batch for large-scale batch jobs.

### **Key EC2 Concepts**

![[Pasted image 20241120195515.png \| 500]]
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Images)**: Pre-configured templates for launching instances with OS and software.
    - Types: Quick Start (AWS defaults), My AMIs (your custom images), AWS Marketplace (third-party apps), Community AMIs (user-shared, be cautious).
- **Instance Types**: Define CPU, memory, and storage, optimized for different workloads.
    - Categories: General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, Accelerated Computing (GPU-based).
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewall to control traffic to/from EC2 instances.
- **Key Pairs**: Public/Private key pairs for secure SSH access to EC2 instances.

### **Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance**

1. **Select an AMI**: Choose a pre-built or custom AMI that matches your app requirements.
2. **Choose an Instance Type**: Select based on CPU, memory, and performance needs.
3. **Configure Network Settings**: Set VPC, subnet, and public IP (if needed).
4. **Attach an IAM Role (Optional)**: Add permissions to allow instance access to other AWS services.
5. **Add a User Data Script (Optional)**: Customize the instance setup, like installing software.
6. **Specify Storage**: Set up root and additional volumes (EBS storage).
7. **Add Tags**: Use tags to organize and identify instances for management.
8. **Configure Security Groups**: Set rules for inbound/outbound traffic.
9. **Select or Create a Key Pair**: Secure access to the instance using the key pair.

### **EC2 Instance Lifecycle States**

- **Pending**: Instance is being launched.
- **Running**: Instance is live and operational.
- **Rebooting**: Instance is rebooting.
- **Shutting Down**: Instance is in the process of shutting down.
- **Terminated**: Instance has been permanently deleted.
- **Stopping**: Instance is being stopped (can be restarted).
- **Stopped**: Instance is stopped but can be started again.

### **EC2 Pricing Models**

- **On-Demand**: Pay by the hour/second without long-term commitment.
- **Reserved**: Save money by reserving instances for 1-3 years at a discounted rate.
- **Spot**: Bid on unused capacity at lower rates, with possible interruptions.
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Rent entire physical servers, ideal for specific licensing requirements.
- **Dedicated Instances**: Isolated from other customers’ instances at the hardware level.

### **Instance Naming Convention** and types

![Pasted image 20241124200548.png](/img/user/AWS%20CLOUD/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241124200548.png)

- **Example**: `t3.micro` – ‘T’ for General Purpose, ‘3’ for generation, ‘micro’ for instance size.
    - **T3 Micro**: 2 vCPUs, 1 GB memory (light apps).
    - **T3 Small**: 2 vCPUs, 2 GB memory (moderate apps).

**Note**: T3 instances can burst CPU usage beyond the baseline when needed.

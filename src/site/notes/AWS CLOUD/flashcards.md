- Auto scaling grp manages the number of instances wheareas elastic load balancing distributes the traffic across them
- High economies of scale** means **reducing costs as the scale of operations increases**. (Means aws continiously tries to lower the costs of its services)

### **Differences Between AWS Billing & Cost Management Tools**

# Storage gateway 
- used to connect on premise storage to aws cloud storage like s3,block storage

# Direct connect
- A **private, dedicated network** link between your data center and AWS for **fast and secure** connectivity.
- **A dedicated fiber-optic connection** is set up between AWS and your on-premises network.

# AWS vpn
- A **secure internet-based connection** between on-premises and AWS VPC.

|Feature|AWS Direct Connect|AWS VPN|
|---|---|---|
|**Speed**|Up to 100 Gbps|Limited by internet|
|**Security**|Private link (no internet)|Encrypted over public internet|
|**Stability**|Very stable|Depends on internet quality|
|**Cost**|Higher upfront, lower transfer cost|Lower setup cost, but higher data transfer costs|

# **AWS Transit Gateway** 
-  A **central hub** that connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks efficiently
- **Example**
- You have **3 VPCs** (Sales, HR, IT) and an **on-premises office network**, Instead of linking each VPC separately, you **connect all to a Transit Gateway**. Now, **all networks can communicate through one central hub** efficiently.

### **AWS Serverless vs. Server-Based Services**

|**Serverless Services**|**Server-Based Services**|
|---|---|
|**AWS Lambda** (Run code without managing servers)|**Amazon EC2** (Virtual servers in the cloud)|
|**Amazon API Gateway** (Manage APIs without servers)|**Amazon RDS** (Managed relational databases)|
|**AWS Fargate** (Serverless container service)|**Amazon ECS (EC2 Launch Type)** (Managed container service with EC2 instances)|
|**Amazon S3** (Object storage, no server management)|**Amazon EBS** (Block storage attached to EC2)|
|**Amazon DynamoDB** (NoSQL database, fully managed)|**Amazon Redshift** (Data warehouse with provisioned servers)|
|**AWS Step Functions** (Orchestration service)|**Amazon EMR** (Big data processing with EC2 clusters)|
|**AWS App Runner** (Deploy and scale applications easily)|**Amazon MQ** (Managed message broker on EC2)|
|**AWS Glue** (ETL and data integration, serverless)|**Amazon OpenSearch Service** (Managed Elasticsearch, requires EC2 instances)|
|**Amazon EventBridge** (Event-driven architecture, no servers)|**Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (EC2 Option)** (Managed application hosting with EC2)|
|**AWS CloudFront** (Content delivery network, fully managed)|**Amazon Lightsail** (Simple cloud server hosting)|
|**AWS Aurora Serverless** (Autoscaling relational DB)|**Amazon FSx** (Managed file storage on EC2 instances)|
|**Amazon SNS** (Pub/Sub messaging, fully managed)|**Amazon Elasticache (EC2-based option)** (In-memory caching on EC2)|
|**Amazon SQS** (Managed message queuing, no servers)|**Amazon Kinesis (EC2-based option)** (Data streaming service with EC2 instances)|

**Key Differences:**

- **Serverless services** automatically **scale**, have **no infrastructure management**, and offer **pay-per-use** pricing.
- **Server-based services** require **manual provisioning**, **server management**, and typically **run on EC2 instances**.

---

**ECS (Elastic Container Service)** is a container orchestration service where you manage the underlying EC2 instances (servers) for running containers.
**Fargate** is a **serverless** compute option for ECS where AWS manages the infrastructure, so you don't have to provision or manage EC2 instances.
**Key Difference**: ECS (with EC2) gives more control over instances, while Fargate is fully managed and abstracts the infrastructure.

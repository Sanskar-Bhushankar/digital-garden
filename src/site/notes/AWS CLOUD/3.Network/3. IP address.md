- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Routes data using **IP addresses** (device identification) and **port numbers** (service identification). Part of **TCP/IP**.
    
- **IP Addresses**: Unique ID for devices, used for **host & network identification**. Works at **OSI Layer 3**.
    
    - **Types**: Dynamic (changes), Static (fixed), Public (internet-accessible), Private (internal use, RFC 1918 ranges).
    - **IPv4**: 32-bit, four octets (0-255). **Network & host portions**.
    - **IPv6**: Hexadecimal, 128-bit, expands address space.
    - **Special Addresses**: Default Router (e.g., 10.0.0.1), Broadcast (last in range).
    - **Conversion**: IPv4 → Binary (e.g., 219.103.21.59 → 11011011.01100111.00010101.00111011).

- **Port Numbers**: Identify services on devices. Work with IPs for communication.
    
    - **Common Ports**: SSH (22), DNS (53), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), RDP (3389).
    - **Security**: Ports can be **blocked/allowed**; tools like **netstat, ss, telnet** help diagnose issues.
- **Layer 3 (Network Layer, OSI Model)**: Translates **logical (IP) to physical (MAC) addresses**, manages **routing & delivery**.
    
- **Troubleshooting**:
    
    - **ping** (check device reachability), **traceroute** (track packet path & loss).
    - IP issues can cause latency/unresponsiveness.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **IP = Device ID**, **Port = Service ID**.
- **IPv4 (32-bit) & IPv6 (128-bit)** differ in structure & capacity.
- **Layer 3 handles logical-physical translation & routing**.
- **Use ping/traceroute for network issues**.

# NotebookLm summarization
This document explains Internet Protocol (IP) networking fundamentals, covering IP addresses, port numbers, and their functions.

**Internet Protocol (IP)**

- IP is a network protocol that establishes the rules for relaying and routing data on the internet.
- It uses **IP addresses** to identify devices and **port numbers** to identify endpoints.
- IP also supports subnetting to subdivide a network.
- When combined with the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**, IP is part of the **TCP/IP protocol suite** that enables the successful routing of network traffic.

**IP Addresses**

- An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
- It identifies both a host and a network and is used for location addressing.
- IP addresses work at layer 3 (networking) of the OSI model.

```
IP Address: A unique identifier for a device on a network, used for host and network identification and location addressing.
```

- IP addresses can be assigned dynamically or statically:
    - A **dynamic IP address** can change. These are useful for devices that move between networks.
    - A **static IP address** does not change. These are useful for devices like servers or printers that are frequently connected to.
- IP addresses can be public or private:
    - A **public IP address** can be accessed over the internet.
    - A **private IP address** cannot be accessed over the internet. It can only be accessed within a logically isolated private network.
- Private IP address ranges, according to RFC 1918, include:
    - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
    - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
    - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
- **IPv4 addresses** consist of four numbers from 0 to 255, separated by periods (also known as a dotted quad), following the IPv4 standard.
    - Each number is an 8-bit binary number, making the entire address a 32-bit binary number.
- An IPv4 address has two parts: the **network portion** and the **host portion**.
    - The network portion is the number assigned to your network.
    - The host portion is the number assigned to each host.
- **IPv6** uses hexadecimal numbers separated by colons and extends the range of IPv4 addresses by a factor of 1,028.
    - IPv6 uses 16 bits instead of IPv4's 8 bits, allowing for a much larger number of available addresses.
- Special purpose IP addresses:
    - The **default router address** (also known as the gateway address) is typically the second address in a range. For example, in the range of 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255, the default router address is 10.0.0.1.
    - The **broadcast address** is the last address in a range. For example, in the range of 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255, the broadcast address is 10.255.255.255.

**IP Address Conversion to Binary**

- Each number in an IPv4 address can be converted to an 8-bit binary number.
- A binary digit (bit) has a value of 0 or 1.
- The IP address 219.103.21.59 converts to binary as 11011011.01100111.00010101.00111011.

**Port Numbers**

- A **port number** identifies a specific application or service on a device.
- It is also known as an endpoint.
- Combined with an IP address, the port number enables a device to determine the exact source or destination of the data.
- Port numbers and IP addresses work together to ensure that messages reach their correct destination.
- Common port numbers include:
    - Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell)
    - Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System)
    - Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    - Port 443: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
    - Port 3389: RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
- Ports can be blocked or allowed to certain traffic for security reasons.
- Troubleshooting commands such as netstat, ss, and telnet can be used in relation to port numbers.

```
Port Number: An identifier that specifies a particular application or service on a device, often used in conjunction with an IP address to create a unique endpoint.
```

**Layer 3 of the OSI Model**

- Layer 3 (the network layer) translates logical network addresses into physical addresses, such as MAC addresses.
- It determines how to deliver messages and how to break them down if they are too large.
- Layer 3 is where the translation between logical and physical addresses takes place.

**Troubleshooting**

- Issues with IP addresses at layer 3 can cause latency or unresponsive servers.
- Troubleshooting commands such as ping and traceroute can be used.
- Traceroute provides a report on the path a packet takes, checking for packet loss.
- Ping can be used to check if a device is reachable.
- Understanding how, where, and what works at each layer assists in troubleshooting basic networking issues.

**Key Takeaways**

- An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
- An IPv4 address consists of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by a dot.
- A port number identifies an application or a service on a device.

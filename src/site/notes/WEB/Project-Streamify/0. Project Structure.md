A proper industry level project structure to begin with 

## 1. To initialize the Project
npm init - By doing npm init we intialize the project in the Current Working Directory, it generates a 'package.json' which contains meta data about the project such as the project's name, version, description, author, and license.
```cmd 
npm init 
```

## 2. To install necessary packages for further development
1. **dotenv**: it stores sensitive data such as your server running port number, database credentials, API keys, etc.
	```cmd
	npm i dotenv
	```
	
	once you installed dotenv make a folder in your root directory .env like this 
	![[env-ss.png \| 400]]

2. nodemon: it just refreshes your server on any file change once runed
	```cmd
	npm i nodemon
	```
	Now to Setup the nodemon in ***package.js****.
	```js
	"scripts": {
	    "dev": "nodemon -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/index.js"
	 },
	```
	- **`nodemon`**: Runs the application with auto-restart on file changes.
	- **`-r dotenv/config`**: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file.
	- **`--experimental-json-modules`**: Enables experimental support for JSON modules, which is useful if you're using ES modules and need to import JSON files like you can import and export.
- Now Start your Server by 
	```cmd 
	npm run dev
	```

3. Express: It is a Node.js Framework used used for building web applications and API, by providing routing, middleware, templating and handle HTTP request and responses.
	```cmd
	npm install express
	```

4. Mongoose: It helps to connect MongoDB with your application 
	```cmd
	npm install mongoose
	```

## 3. Setting the file Structure

```js
backend/
 |- src/
	  |- controllers/ - (API endpoint handlers)
	  |- db/ - (database connection and schema)
	  |- middlewares/ - (request and response middleware functions)
	  |- models/ - (data models and schema definitions)
	  |- utils/ - (utility functions and helpers)
	  |- constant.js - (application-wide constants)
	  |- index.js - (main application entry point)
 |-.env - (environment variables and secrets)
 |-.gitignore - (files and folders to ignore in Git)
 |- package.json - (project metadata and dependencies)
 |- package-lock.json - (dependency tree and version locks)
 ```

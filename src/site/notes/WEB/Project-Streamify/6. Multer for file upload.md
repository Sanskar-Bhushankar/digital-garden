Multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files in Node.js and Express applications. 
It processes incoming form data and allows files to be uploaded and saved locally or in memory.

### 1.  Installing Multer

```shell
npm install multer
```

### 2. File Upload with Multer

`src/middleware/multer middleware.js`
```js
import multer from 'multer';

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, cb) {
        cb(null, './public/temp')
    },
    filename: function (req, file, cb) {
        const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9)
        cb(null, file.originalname)
    }
})
export const upload = multer({ storage, })
```

- It creates a storage system that saves uploaded files to a folder called "temp" inside the "public" directory.
- When a file is uploaded, it generates a unique filename by using the current date and time, and a random number.
- However, instead of using the unique filename, it actually uses the original filename of the uploaded file.
- The code then exports a variable called "upload" which is an instance of Multer, configured to use the storage system it just created.

### 1. difference between int and big int
   -  difference lies in the size of each int is of `4 bytes` which is from `-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647` whereas the big int is of     `8 bytes` which is from `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807` 
 -  note that `BIGINT` uses more storage and may have performance implications.

### 2. Difference between char and varchar
The main difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` in SQL is how they store and manage string length:
* `CHAR(n)` is **fixed-length**: it always stores exactly *n* characters, padding with spaces if the input is shorter.
* `VARCHAR(n)` is **variable-length**: it stores only the number of characters entered, up to *n*, with no padding.
**Example:**
```sql
-- CHAR(5)
INSERT INTO test_char VALUES ('Hi');  
-- Stored as: 'Hi   ' (with 3 trailing spaces)

-- VARCHAR(5)
INSERT INTO test_varchar VALUES ('Hi');  
-- Stored as: 'Hi' (no extra spaces)
```
Use `CHAR` when values are always the same length (e.g., fixed codes like 'A123'), and `VARCHAR` when lengths vary (e.g., names, emails).

**Yes, `CHAR` can be slightly faster than `VARCHAR`** — but only in very specific scenarios. Fixed-length makes **memory allocation predictable** and makes indexing faster

### 3. what are the types of sql commands
1. DQL - Data query language `Used to retrieve data from databases. (SELECT)`
2. DDL - data definition language `Used to create, alter, and delete database objects like tables, indexes, etc. (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE)`
3. DML - data manipulation lang `Used to modify the database. (INSERT,UPDATE, DELETE)`
4. DCL - data control language `Used to grant & revoke permissions. (GRANT,REVOKE)`
5. TQL - Transaction control language `Used to manage transactions. (COMMIT,ROLLBACK, START TRANSACTIONS, SAVEPOINT)`

A **transaction** is a group of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit of work, ensuring data integrity.
**Key properties (ACID):**
* **A**tomicity: all or nothing
* **C**onsistency: data remains valid
* **I**solation: no interference from other transactions
* **D**urability: once committed, changes are permanent
**Example:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
```
If an error occurs, you can `ROLLBACK` to undo all operations.

### 3. primary key - foreign key [3. Keys](3.%20Keys.md)
A foreign key is a column in one table that links to the primary key of another table.  
It creates a relationship between two tables.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE StudentCourse (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id)
);
```
##### Unique key
- primary key identifies each record uniquely in the table where there can be no null or double records also in a table there can be only one primary key
- wheras unique key is also a unique identfier of the column but the values can be zero and there can be multiple unique key columns 
##### candidate key
a column or set of columns that can qualify as unique identifier
a table has multiple candidate key but only one is choosen as primary key
##### alternate key
a candidate key which is not choosen as primary key still unique and can be used

## 🔹 **1. What are constraints in SQL? Name types.**

**Expected answer:**
Constraints are rules applied on columns to **enforce data integrity**.

**Types:**

* `PRIMARY KEY`
* `FOREIGN KEY`
* `NOT NULL`
* `UNIQUE`
* `CHECK`
* `DEFAULT`

---

## 🔹 **2. Create a table with all types of constraints.**

**Question:**
Create a `students` table where:

* `id` is the primary key
* `name` cannot be null
* `marks` must be between 0 and 100
* `email` should be unique
* `dept` defaults to 'CSE'

**Answer:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    marks INT CHECK (marks >= 0 AND marks <= 100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    dept VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'CSE'
);
```

---

## 🔹 **3. What's the difference between `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY`?**

| Feature         | `PRIMARY KEY`            | `UNIQUE`               |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Nulls allowed?  | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes (1 or more)      |
| Count per table | 1 only                   | Many allowed           |
| Purpose         | Uniquely identifies rows | Enforces unique values |

---

## 🔹 **4. Can a table have multiple primary keys?**

**Correct answer:** No. A table can only have **one `PRIMARY KEY`**, but it can consist of **multiple columns** (called a **composite key**).

```sql
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    student_id INT,
    date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, date)
);
```

---

## 🔹 **5. What is the default constraint?**

Sets a default value when no value is provided.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'active'
);
```

---

## 🔹 **6. How to add a constraint after table creation?**

```sql
-- Add NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE students
ALTER COLUMN name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;

-- Add CHECK
ALTER TABLE students
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_marks CHECK (marks >= 0 AND marks <= 100);
```

---

## 🔹 **7. What is a foreign key? Give an example.**

Links one table's column to another's primary key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)
);
```

---

## 🔹 **8. What happens if you try to insert duplicate in a `UNIQUE` column?**

You get a **constraint violation error** — SQL Server won't allow it.

---

## 🔹 **9. Can you disable constraints temporarily?**

Yes, in SQL Server:

```sql
ALTER TABLE students NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
```

But this is **not recommended** unless you're doing controlled bulk operations.

---

## 🔹 **10. What’s the order of constraint evaluation?**

When inserting data, constraints are checked in this rough order:

* `NOT NULL`
* `DEFAULT`
* `CHECK`
* `UNIQUE`
* `FOREIGN KEY`
* `PRIMARY KEY`

This helps when debugging constraint errors.

---

## 🔶 1. **Composite Keys vs Surrogate Keys**

> **Question:** What are the pros and cons of using composite primary keys over surrogate (auto-increment) keys in large databases?

**What they look for:**

* Understanding normalization
* How primary keys affect indexing and joins
* Tradeoffs between natural vs artificial keys

---

## 🔶 2. **Multi-column Unique Constraint**

> **Question:** Create a table where `email` and `phone` can be duplicated separately, but not together.

**Expected:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    CONSTRAINT unique_email_phone UNIQUE (email, phone)
);
```

---

## 🔶 3. **Complex CHECK Constraints**

> **Question:** Allow students to have marks only if their age is at least 18.

**Expected:**

```sql
CHECK (age >= 18 OR marks IS NULL)
```

They want to see if you can implement **business logic** using constraints.

---

## 🔶 4. **Self-Referential Foreign Key**

> **Question:** Create a table `employees` where `manager_id` is a foreign key to `employee_id` in the same table.

**Expected:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);
```

**Follow-up:** What happens if a manager is deleted?

---

## 🔶 5. **Cyclic or Cascading Deletes**

> **Question:** What happens if two tables have circular foreign keys with `ON DELETE CASCADE`?

They're checking if you understand **referential cycles** and **danger of accidental mass deletions**.

---

## 🔶 6. **Add a constraint that a student's `marks` must be higher than all others in their `dept`**

This can’t be done with a simple `CHECK`. You'd need:

* **Triggers**
* **Procedural code (T-SQL)**

This shows you understand **limitations of constraints**.

---

## 🔶 7. **What’s the difference between `UNIQUE` constraint vs `DISTINCT` in a SELECT?**

* `UNIQUE` affects **data storage** (prevents duplicates).
* `DISTINCT` only affects **query results** (hides duplicates in output).

---

## 🔶 8. **Why shouldn't we use `NULL` in a PRIMARY KEY?**

* Violates **uniqueness** requirement.
* Even if allowed syntactically (in some databases), it's **logically incorrect** because `NULL ≠ NULL`.

---

## 🔶 9. **Enforcing ENUM-like values without ENUM keyword**

> How would you restrict a `gender` column to only 'M', 'F', 'O' in SQL Server?

**Expected:**

```sql
CHECK (gender IN ('M', 'F', 'O'))
```

---

## 🔶 10. **Design Question: What constraints would you apply to a `bank_accounts` table?**

This is open-ended. A good answer would include:

* `account_id` → `PRIMARY KEY`
* `balance` → `CHECK (balance >= 0)`
* `account_type` → `CHECK (account_type IN (...))`
* `customer_id` → `FOREIGN KEY` to `customers`
* Maybe a `UNIQUE` constraint on `account_number`

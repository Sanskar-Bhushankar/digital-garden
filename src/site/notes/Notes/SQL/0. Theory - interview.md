### 1. difference between int and big int
   -  difference lies in the size of each int is of `4 bytes` which is from `-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647` whereas the big int is of     `8 bytes` which is from `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807` 
 -  note that `BIGINT` uses more storage and may have performance implications.

### 2. Difference between char and varchar
The main difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` in SQL is how they store and manage string length:
* `CHAR(n)` is **fixed-length**: it always stores exactly *n* characters, padding with spaces if the input is shorter.
* `VARCHAR(n)` is **variable-length**: it stores only the number of characters entered, up to *n*, with no padding.
**Example:**
```sql
-- CHAR(5)
INSERT INTO test_char VALUES ('Hi');  
-- Stored as: 'Hi   ' (with 3 trailing spaces)

-- VARCHAR(5)
INSERT INTO test_varchar VALUES ('Hi');  
-- Stored as: 'Hi' (no extra spaces)
```
Use `CHAR` when values are always the same length (e.g., fixed codes like 'A123'), and `VARCHAR` when lengths vary (e.g., names, emails).

**Yes, `CHAR` can be slightly faster than `VARCHAR`** â€” but only in very specific scenarios. Fixed-length makes **memory allocation predictable** and makes indexing faster

### 3. what are the types of sql commands
1. DQL - Data query language `Used to retrieve data from databases. (SELECT)`
2. DDL - data definition language `Used to create, alter, and delete database objects like tables, indexes, etc. (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE)`
3. DML - data manipulation lang `Used to modify the database. (INSERT,UPDATE, DELETE)`
4. DCL - data control language `Used to grant & revoke permissions. (GRANT,REVOKE)`
5. TQL - Transaction control language `Used to manage transactions. (COMMIT,ROLLBACK, START TRANSACTIONS, SAVEPOINT)`

A **transaction** is a group of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit of work, ensuring data integrity.
**Key properties (ACID):**
* **A**tomicity: all or nothing
* **C**onsistency: data remains valid
* **I**solation: no interference from other transactions
* **D**urability: once committed, changes are permanent
**Example:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
```
If an error occurs, you can `ROLLBACK` to undo all operations.

### 3. primary key - foreign key [3. Keys](3.%20Keys.md)
A foreign key is a column in one table that links to the primary key of another table.  
It creates a relationship between two tables.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE StudentCourse (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id)
);
```
##### Unique key
- primary key identifies each record uniquely in the table where there can be no null or double records also in a table there can be only one primary key
- wheras unique key is also a unique identfier of the column but the values can be zero and there can be multiple unique key columns 
##### candidate key
a column or set of columns that can qualify as unique identifier
a table has multiple candidate key but only one is choosen as primary key
##### alternate key
a candidate key which is not choosen as primary key still unique and can be used

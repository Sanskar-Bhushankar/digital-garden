```sql
select emp_name,salary from employee where salary >(select avg(salary) from employee);
```
here we are using 2 query to get a query

---
# 1. scalar subquery
A scalar subquery is a subquery used in a context where a single value is expected, like in the SELECT, WHERE, or SET clause.

```sql
select avg(salary) from employee
```
or
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees AS highest_salary
```
---

# 2. Multiple row subquery

--subquery which returns multiple column and multiple rows
--subquery which returns one 1 row multiple column or 1 column multiple row


```sql
mysql> select * from employee;
+--------+----------+----------+---------+------------+
| emp_id | emp_name | salary   | dept_id | manager_id |
+--------+----------+----------+---------+------------+
|    101 | Alice    | 60000.00 |       1 |       NULL |
|    102 | Bob      | 55000.00 |       1 |        101 |
|    103 | Charlie  | 90000.00 |       2 |       NULL |
|    104 | David    | 75000.00 |       2 |        103 |

## Find max salary and name of the employee from each dept 

```sql
select e.emp_name,e.salary,e.dept_id from employee e
join (select max(salary) as sal ,dept_id from employee group by dept_id) as maxs
on e.dept_id=maxs.dept_id and e.salary=maxs.sal
limit 4;
```


## Find the department who dosent have any employees;
here we know its cs department
so
always go one query at a time so first find the the depart who has employees from emp table after then find distinct of them and then in the main query do `not in`
```sql
select * from department where dept_id not in(select distinct(dept_id) from employee);
```

# 3. correlated subquery

its a subquery which is related to outerquery and cannot be runned standalone

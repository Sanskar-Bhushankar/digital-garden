### Simple Explanation:

If one table (child) refers to another tableâ€™s (parent) primary key using a **foreign key**, referential integrity ensures that:
- You **cannot insert** a value in the child table that doesn't exist in the parent table.
- You **cannot delete** a row from the parent table if the child table still references it (unless `ON DELETE` rules are set).
### Example:
#### Parent table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
  dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```
#### Child table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_name VARCHAR(100),
  dept_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);
```
### What Referential Integrity Does Here:
- **Insert**: You cannot insert an employee with `dept_id = 10` unless that department exists in `Departments`.
- **Delete**: You cannot delete a department if employees are still linked to it, unless you use `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
### Options to Handle It:

- `ON DELETE CASCADE`: Delete child rows automatically.
- `ON DELETE SET NULL`: Set foreign key to NULL in child when parent is deleted.
- Default: Block deletion or update if linked.
Referential integrity prevents data inconsistency across related tables.

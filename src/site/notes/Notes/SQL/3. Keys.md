###  What is a Primary Key?

A **primary key** is a column (or set of columns) that **uniquely identifies each row** in a table.
It **cannot be NULL** and **must be unique**.
 Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```
* Here, `student_id` is the **primary key**.
* It makes sure each student has a **unique ID** â€” no duplicates, no NULLs.
---
###  What is a Foreign Key?
A foreign key is a column in one table that links to the primary key of another table.
It creates a relationship between two tables.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE StudentCourse (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id)
);
```
student_id in StudentCourse is a foreign key.
It ensures that student_id in StudentCourse must exist in the Students table.

---
### What is a Composite Key?

A **composite key** is made up of **two or more columns** that **together uniquely identify** a row.
No single column in the combination is unique on its own.
ðŸ“Œ Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE StudentCourse (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    grade CHAR(1),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```
* Here, **`(student_id, course_id)`** is the **composite key**.
* This means a student can take many courses, and a course can have many students, but the pair must be unique.
##### ðŸ”Ž Why Do We Need a Composite Key? (With Simple Example)
Imagine this scenario:
Youâ€™re tracking **which students enrolled in which courses** â€” each student can take **many** courses, and each course has **many** students.
 Table: `StudentCourse`

| student\_id | course\_id | grade |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 101         | 501        | A     |
| 101         | 502        | B     |
| 102         | 501        | A     |

Now:
* `student_id` alone is **not unique** â€” because student `101` appears twice.
* `course_id` alone is **not unique** â€” course `501` appears twice.
 But the **pair (student\_id, course\_id)** is unique â€” no student can enroll in the **same course twice**.
 So Why Use Composite Key?
Without it:
* You could accidentally enter the same student-course combo multiple times (duplicate data).
* Data becomes inconsistent, and grade tracking breaks.
With composite key `(student_id, course_id)`:
* You guarantee that **each student-course pair appears only once** â€” maintaining data integrity.

###  Advanced Key-Based Interview Questions

#### 1. **In a table with a composite primary key, can one column be NULL? Why or why not?**

**Answer:**
No. All columns in a composite primary key must be **NOT NULL**, because the key must uniquely and completely identify each row â€” NULL would violate uniqueness and completeness.

---

#### 2. **How would you handle a foreign key that references a composite key in another table?**

**Answer:**
You must create a foreign key that includes **both columns** matching the composite key in order and data type.

```sql
-- Parent table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);

-- Child table
CREATE TABLE Shipments (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id, product_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id, product_id)
);
```

---

#### 3. **Can a table have multiple foreign keys referencing the same table but different keys? How would you design this?**

**Answer:**
Yes. Example: a `Transaction` table with both `sender_id` and `receiver_id` referencing the `Users` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sender_id INT,
    receiver_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (receiver_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

---

#### 4. **In what scenarios would you avoid using composite keys and use surrogate keys instead?**

**Answer:**
When:

* Composite keys become large and complex (bad for indexing & joins).
* Relationships are many-to-many but frequently queried.
* Need to decouple business logic from identifiers.

Surrogate key example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE StudentCourse (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT
);
```

---

#### 5. **How does a composite key affect performance in large-scale joins?**

**Answer:**
Negatively â€” composite keys:

* Increase index size and lookup cost.
* Slow down joins due to multiple column comparisons.
  Use surrogate keys for faster performance in large joins.

## Unique key

- primary key identifies each record uniquely in the table where there can be no null or double records also in a table there can be only one primary key
- wheras unique key is also a unique identfier of the column but the values can be zero and there can be multiple unique key columns 

### candidate key
a column or set of columns that can qualify as unique identifier
a table has multiple candidate key but only one is choosen as primary key
### alternate key
a candidate key which is not choosen as primary key still unique and can be used

1.  to use `describe table` which is used in mysql if we want to use it in server use
	   `exec sp_help students` - students is the table name

2. if we want to list all the table names like `show tables` in mysql
	   `select name from sys.tables`
	   for databases name listing do `select name from sys.databases;`
3. in sql server we dont have the `limit` keyword to limit show the rows so we use
```
select top 3 dept,count(name) from students
group by dept;
```

4. to rename a column name in sqlserver
   `exec sp_rename 'students.marks','student_marks','column';`
5. use of procedure

```sql
create procedure sup 
as 
begin
select * from suppliers;
end
go
```
or with params
```sql
create procedure sup_name @city varchar(50)
as
begin
select * from suppliers where city=@city
end
go

--to run this
exec sup_name @city='surat';
```

**"The `WHERE` clause is used to filter individual rows before any grouping happens, while the `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups after using `GROUP BY`.**
For example, if I want to select only students who scored above 80, I use `WHERE`.
But if I want to find names of students who appear more than once, I group them by name and use `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`."\*\*
### Bonus:
You can say:
> "`WHERE` works on raw data, `HAVING` works on aggregated data."

That shows you understand when to use which.

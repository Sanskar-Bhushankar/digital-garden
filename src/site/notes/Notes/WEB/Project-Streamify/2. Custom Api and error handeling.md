## 1.API Error Handling

The `ApiError` class is a custom error class extending the built-in `Error` class in JavaScript. 
This class is designed to handle errors in an organized way within an API application, providing extra details like HTTP status codes, error messages, and specific error details.

### Code Structure and Explanation

src/utils/ApiError.js
```javascript
class ApiError extends Error {
    constructor(
        statusCode,
        message = "Something went wrong",
        errors = [],
        stack = ""
    ) {
        super(message);
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.data = null;
        this.message = message;
        this.success = false;
        this.errors = errors;

        if (stack) {
            this.stack = stack;
        } else {
            Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
        }
    }
}

export { ApiError };
```

### Explanation

1. **Class Definition**: `ApiError` extends the `Error` class, which allows it to function as a standard error with added custom properties. This enables more structured error handling in API responses.

2. **Constructor Parameters**:
   - `statusCode`: An HTTP status code, like `404` or `500`, representing the error type.
   - `message`: A custom message describing the error. Defaults to `"Something went wrong"`.
   - `errors`: An array holding additional details about the error, such as validation issues.
   - `stack`: An optional parameter for a custom stack trace, which helps locate where the error occurred in the code.

3. **Properties Set in Constructor**:
   - `super(message)`: Calls the parent `Error` class’s constructor with `message`, making `ApiError` an instance of `Error`.
   - `this.statusCode`: Stores the HTTP status code associated with this error.
   - `this.data`: Initialized as `null` and can hold additional information if needed.
   - `this.message`: Stores the custom error message.
   - `this.success`: Set to `false` to indicate that the API call failed.
   - `this.errors`: Holds the array of additional error details.

4. **Stack Trace Handling**:
   - If a `stack` is provided, it’s assigned to `this.stack`.
   - Otherwise, `Error.captureStackTrace` is called, creating a detailed stack trace starting from `ApiError`’s instantiation. This helps developers trace where the error was created in the code.
### Usage Example

Here’s how you might use `ApiError` in an API route:

```javascript
app.get('/some-endpoint', (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        // Code that might throw an error
        throw new ApiError(404, "Resource not found", ["Missing item"], "");
    } catch (error) {
        next(error); // Passes the error to error-handling middleware
    }
});
```

In this example, an `ApiError` with a `404` status code and a specific error message is thrown, along with error details (`["Missing item"]`). This error can be caught by error-handling middleware, which will format it for the client.

## 2. API Response Handling

The `ApiResponses` class is designed to create standardized responses for API endpoints.  This setup provides consistency and clarity when sending responses from an API.

### Code Structure and Explanation

src/utils/ApiError.js
```javascript
class ApiResponses {
    constructor(statusCode, data, message = "Success") {
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.data = data;
        this.message = message;
        this.success = statusCode < 400;
    }
}

export { ApiResponses };
```

### Explanation

1. **Class Definition**: `ApiResponses` is a class that wraps API response details into a single object, making it easy to manage and return responses in a structured way.

2. **Constructor Parameters**:
   - `statusCode`: The HTTP status code (like `200` for success or `404` for not found) that indicates the outcome of the API request.
   - `data`: The main content of the response, such as data fetched from the database or created as a result of the request.
   - `message`: A message summarizing the response. It defaults to `"Success"` but can be customized for various responses.

3. **Properties Set in Constructor**:
   - `this.statusCode`: Stores the HTTP status code, defining whether the request was successful (usually below `400`). Using `statusCode < 400` is a way to check if an API response is successful or not. In HTTP, status codes are categorized as follows:

	- **2xx**: Success responses (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created)
	- **3xx**: Redirection responses (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently)
	- **4xx**: Client errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
	- **5xx**: Server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)

	In the `ApiResponses` class, setting `this.success = statusCode < 400` means:

- **If `statusCode` is less than 400** (like 200 or 201), it’s treated as a successful response, so `success` is set to `true`.
- **If `statusCode` is 400 or above** (like 404 or 500), it’s considered an error response, so `success` is set to `false`.
   - `this.data`: Holds the main data of the response.
   - `this.message`: Provides a summary of the response, such as `"Success"` for successful requests or a custom message.
   - `this.success`: Automatically set to `true` if `statusCode` is less than `400`, meaning the response was successful. Otherwise, it’s set to `false`.

### Usage Example

This example shows how to use the `ApiResponses` class to return a standardized response from an API endpoint:

```javascript
app.get('/some-endpoint', (req, res) => {
    const data = { id: 1, name: "Sample Item" };
    const response = new ApiResponses(200, data, "Data fetched successfully");
    res.json(response);
});
```

In this example:
- A `200` status code indicates success.
- `data` contains the fetched item details.
- A message of `"Data fetched successfully"` describes the response.
- `success` is `true` since `200 < 400`.

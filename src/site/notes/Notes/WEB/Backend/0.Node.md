## Node.js Overview

- **Introduction to Node.js:**
  - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript on the server side. 
  - It was created by Ryan Dahl, utilizing the open-source Google Chrome V8 engine written in C++.
  - Dahl developed a wrapper around the V8 engine to convert JavaScript code into V8-compatible code, enabling backend functionalities.

## Setting Up a Node.js Project

1. **Open a folder in Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Initialize npm (Node Package Manager):**
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     npm init  # or use npm init -y for default settings
     ```
   - This command creates a `package.json` file in the project directory, which manages the project dependencies and metadata.



In Node.js, **EJS** and **ESM** refer to two different concepts that often get mixed up due to their similar acronyms:

1. **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**:
   - EJS is a templating language that lets you generate HTML using JavaScript code. It’s useful when you want to create dynamic HTML pages.
   - You can insert JavaScript code directly in your HTML by using `<% %>` tags.
   - Example: It’s often used in Express apps for rendering HTML pages with dynamic content.

2. **ESM (ECMAScript Modules)**:
   - ESM is a standard way to handle JavaScript modules. It allows you to import and export code between different files using `import` and `export` statements.
   - ESM is the modern module format in JavaScript and is now natively supported in Node.js (with `.mjs` files or by setting `"type": "module"` in `package.json`).
   - Example: ESM helps organize code by separating it into smaller modules, which makes it reusable and easier to manage.
### Key Difference:
- **EJS** is a template engine for generating HTML.
- **ESM** is a module system for structuring and sharing JavaScript code across files.

## Npm scripts (run/test)

- **NPM Start and Test Commands**  
  "npm start" and "npm test" are special commands in NPM that you can run directly without adding "run" because they’re set up in your system automatically.

- **How Commands Work in the System**  
  Your operating system has a list of known commands, so when you type "npm start," it recognizes it immediately. But if you type something random, it won’t recognize it and will show an error.

- **Using 'npm run' for Custom Commands**  
  For any custom scripts you add (other than start and test), you need to type "npm run" first. This tells NPM to look for the command in your package.json scripts.

- **Creating Your Own Commands**  
  You can make custom commands by adding them to the "scripts" section in your package.json file. For example, you could add a command called "chacha" and then run it with "npm run chacha."

- **Running Custom Commands Example**  
  In the example, a script called "chacha" is created to print a message. Running "npm run chacha" then prints the message, showing how to use custom commands in NPM.

`Redux is a JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management.`

[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

RTK includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including [store setup](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore), [creating reducers and writing immutable update logic](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createreducer), and even [creating entire "slices" of state at once](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice).

==Redux is a JavaScript library used to manage **global state** in an app. It stores all the app data in one place (called a **store**) and updates it using actions and reducers.==

==**Redux Toolkit** is the official, easier, and better way to write Redux logic. It reduces boilerplate code and gives useful tools out of the box like `createSlice`, `configureStore`, etc==

here in react we install 2 packages
```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

You install 2 packages because:
1. `@reduxjs/toolkit` is used to create and manage the Redux store easily.
2. `react-redux` lets you use Redux with React components.

store - single source of truth
reducers 
useSelector
useDispatch

## Making a button as a prop passing the function

![|800](/img/user/Notes/React/attachments/Pasted image 20250516163815.png)

You're doing **3 key things correctly** in your code — here's a breakdown in **simple terms**:

 ✅ 1. **Passing a function and text as props**
In `App.jsx`, you're passing:
```jsx
<Cards handle={handleClick} text="clickme">
```
* `handle={handleClick}` → You're passing a **function** to be used as the `onClick` handler.
* `text="clickme"` → You're passing a **string** that will be shown on the button.
---
✅ 2. **Passing `children` (JSX content)**
Inside `<Cards>...</Cards>`, you're placing:
```jsx
<h1>{count}</h1>
```
This JSX becomes `props.children` in the `Cards` component.
So `props.children = <h1>{count}</h1>`

---
 ✅ 3. **Using everything properly in `Cards.jsx`**
In `Cards.jsx`:
```jsx
<>
  {props.children}       // shows <h1>{count}</h1>
  <button onClick={props.handle}>
    {props.text}         // shows "clickme"
  </button>
</>
```

* `{props.children}` → renders the heading with the count
* `<button onClick={props.handle}>` → uses the passed function for button click
* `{props.text}` → sets the button's label

| Prop       | What you passed        | How it's used                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `handle`   | `handleClick` function | Runs on `onClick` of button   |
| `text`     | `"clickme"`            | Displayed as button text      |
| `children` | `<h1>{count}</h1>`     | Rendered inside the component |

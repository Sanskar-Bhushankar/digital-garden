# SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL

### Overview: AWS Shared Responsibility Model

- **Definition:**  
    The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines which security tasks are handled by AWS and which are the customer’s responsibility. It is divided into two broad categories:
    
    - **Security “of” the cloud:** AWS manages the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud (hardware, software, networking, and facilities).
    - **Security “in” the cloud:** Customers manage the security of their data, applications, operating systems, network configurations, and more.
- **Why It Matters for Exams:**  
    AWS exam questions often ask, “Which of the following is a customer responsibility?” or “What does AWS manage in this scenario?” The key is understanding the boundary between AWS-managed services and what you must secure yourself.
    
- **Skeptical Reminder:**  
    Don’t assume that because a service is “managed” by AWS, every detail is taken care of. Look closely at the service type (IaaS vs. PaaS) and know exactly what AWS handles versus what you must configure.

## Detailed Breakdown by Service

### 1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- **AWS Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Physical Infrastructure:**  
        AWS manages data center facilities, power, cooling, physical security, and hardware replacement.
    - **Networking and Hypervisor:**  
        The hypervisor that abstracts physical resources is maintained and secured by AWS.
- **Customer Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Guest Operating System:**  
        You must patch and update the operating system running on your EC2 instance. For example, if you run a Linux distribution, you are responsible for applying security patches and updates.
    - **Application Software:**  
        Installing, configuring, and updating any applications or middleware on your instance.
    - **Security Configurations:**  
        Configuring security groups, firewall rules, and network ACLs that protect the instance.
    - **Data Encryption and Backup:**  
        Managing encryption of data stored on the instance (unless using AWS services that provide managed encryption) and configuring backup strategies.
- **Exam Tip:**  
    Expect questions that ask which tasks (e.g., patching the OS, managing physical servers) fall under the customer’s responsibility. The key point is that AWS secures the physical and hypervisor layers, but you secure everything running on top.
    
### 2. Databases

#### A. Managed Database Services (e.g., Amazon RDS)

- **AWS Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Infrastructure & OS:**  
        AWS takes care of the underlying hardware, operating system, and database engine patching for the managed service.
    - **Automated Backups and Failover:**  
        Many RDS features, such as automated backups and Multi-AZ deployments, are managed by AWS.
- **Customer Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Database Configuration:**  
        Configuring database parameters, managing users and roles, and setting access controls.
    - **Data and Application-Level Security:**  
        Ensuring that encryption is configured properly (if using customer-managed keys), controlling network access (e.g., through VPC security groups), and managing SQL injection prevention.
    - **Performance Tuning & Query Optimization:**  
        The customer is responsible for optimizing queries and schema design.
- **Example:**  
    In an RDS MySQL deployment, while AWS ensures that the OS and DB engine receive patches, you must define the database’s security groups, manage database user accounts, and ensure that your applications access the database securely.
    
- **Exam Tip:**  
    Questions may contrast RDS (a managed service) with self-managed databases on EC2. Know that in RDS, you do not patch the underlying OS or database engine software—but you do control configuration, access, and data protection.
    

#### B. Self-Managed Databases on EC2

- **AWS Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Physical and Virtual Infrastructure:**  
        As with any EC2 instance, AWS manages the data center, hypervisor, and underlying hardware.
- **Customer Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Complete Software Stack:**  
        You must install, patch, and maintain the database software, as well as the guest operating system.
    - **Database Administration:**  
        This includes backups, recovery, performance tuning, and security hardening.
    - **Access Control:**  
        Configure firewalls, security groups, and encryption mechanisms for the database.
- **Exam Tip:**  
    Know that when you run your own database on EC2, you assume more responsibility compared to managed services like RDS.
    

### 3. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **AWS Responsibilities:**
    
    - **IAM Service Availability:**  
        AWS ensures that the IAM service is available, reliable, and up-to-date from an infrastructure perspective.
    - **Underlying Platform Security:**  
        AWS secures the physical and underlying network layers that support IAM.
- **Customer Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Policy Creation and Management:**  
        You design, create, and manage IAM policies, users, roles, and groups. For example, you must decide who has access to which AWS resources and what level of permissions they receive.
    - **Credential Management:**  
        You are responsible for managing and rotating credentials, such as access keys and passwords.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
        Implementing MFA for critical IAM users is a customer responsibility.
    - **Monitoring and Auditing:**  
        Customers should regularly review IAM policies and use AWS CloudTrail to audit actions.
- **Example:**  
    When creating an IAM role for an EC2 instance to access S3, you must specify the exact permissions in the role’s policy. AWS provides the role service, but the rules and limitations are defined by you.
    
- **Exam Tip:**  
    Expect detailed questions on IAM where you need to identify what a customer must manage versus what is automated by AWS. Emphasize that **all identity and access configurations are customer-managed**.
    

---

## Additional Exam-Focused Points

- **Service-Level Differences:**  
    Understand that AWS’s responsibilities differ by service type. For instance, in IaaS (like EC2), you manage a larger portion of the software stack compared to PaaS (like RDS).
    
- **Shared Responsibility Misconceptions:**
    
    - **“Managed” does not mean “set and forget”:** Even with managed services like RDS, you must carefully configure access, monitor performance, and handle application-level security.
    - **Layered Security:** Always think in layers. AWS secures the lower layers (physical, network, and hypervisor), but you must secure everything from the operating system upward.
- **Practical Scenarios:**
    
    - **EC2 Scenario:** If a vulnerability is discovered in the OS of your EC2 instance, AWS won’t patch it for you—you must update your instance.
    - **Database Scenario:** If your RDS instance’s backup configuration is misconfigured, it’s your responsibility to correct it, even though AWS handles the backup process.
    - **IAM Scenario:** If an IAM user’s permissions are too broad and lead to a security breach, it’s the result of your policy design, not an AWS failure.
- **Study Tip:**  
    When you see exam questions on the Shared Responsibility Model, look for keywords like “customer responsibility,” “patching,” “configuration,” or “access control.” These clues help you decide which actions fall under your purview.

## Conclusion

In summary, the AWS Shared Responsibility Model is a critical concept that defines the security boundaries between AWS and the customer. For EC2, customers are responsible for securing the guest OS, applications, and data. For databases, the division depends on whether you use a managed service (like RDS) or a self-managed database on EC2. With IAM, the customer holds full responsibility for policies, access management, and credential security.

Keep these points in mind when studying for your exam, and always question any assumption that “AWS takes care of it all”—you are expected to secure everything that runs on top of the AWS-managed infrastructure.

# Overview: AWS Management & Monitoring Services

AWS offers several services to help you monitor, audit, and secure your environment. Understanding each service’s role is critical when exam questions ask, for example, “Where would you go to check who deleted a security group?” or “Which service tracks configuration changes over time?” Below is a breakdown of the key services:

- **CloudTrail**  
    **Purpose:** Auditing and recording API calls and actions made in your AWS account.  
    **Use Cases:**
    
    - Tracking who made changes (e.g., security group modifications, resource deletions, IAM changes).
    - Forensic analysis and compliance audits.  
        **Exam Tip:** If a question involves “who did what” in your account (like a security group change or resource deletion), think CloudTrail.
- **CloudWatch**  
    **Purpose:** Monitoring operational metrics and logs for performance and health.  
    **Components:**
    
    - **CloudWatch Metrics:** For collecting performance data (CPU, memory, etc.).
    - **CloudWatch Logs:** For application and system logs.
    - **CloudWatch Alarms:** To alert you when thresholds are breached.  
        **Use Cases:**
    - Setting alarms when an EC2 instance’s CPU usage spikes.
    - Aggregating application logs for troubleshooting.  
        **Exam Tip:** When a question involves performance issues or log analytics (not API-level events), lean toward CloudWatch.
- **AWS Config**  
    **Purpose:** Recording and tracking the configuration history of your AWS resources.  
    **Use Cases:**
    
    - Monitoring and recording configuration changes over time.
    - Evaluating compliance by comparing current configurations against desired rules (e.g., “Did someone change the security group settings?”).  
        **Exam Tip:** For questions about configuration drift or changes over time (like a security group alteration or unauthorized resource modification), AWS Config is the answer.
- **AWS Inspector**  
    **Purpose:** Security assessment of AWS workloads, especially for vulnerability scanning and best practice checks on EC2 instances.  
    **Use Cases:**
    
    - Running automated security assessments against your EC2 instances.
    - Identifying vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices.  
        **Exam Tip:** When a question mentions vulnerability scans or security assessments (and it involves EC2 or container-based workloads), consider Inspector.
- **AWS Security Hub**  
    **Purpose:** Centralizing and correlating security findings from various AWS services and third-party tools.  
    **Use Cases:**
    
    - Aggregating alerts from GuardDuty, Inspector, and other security services.
    - Providing a comprehensive view of your security posture.  
        **Exam Tip:** Use Security Hub when questions revolve around the overall security status of your environment or when multiple security findings need to be consolidated.
- **AWS X-Ray**  
    **Purpose:** Tracing and debugging distributed applications.  
    **Use Cases:**
    
    - Analyzing and visualizing requests as they travel through your application.
    - Identifying performance bottlenecks in microservices architectures.  
        **Exam Tip:** If a question is focused on application performance and tracing the path of a request (rather than security or configuration changes), X-Ray is your service.

## Exam Tips

- **Key Distinctions:**
    
    - **CloudTrail vs. AWS Config:**
        - **CloudTrail** is about recording API calls (who did what, when, where).
        - **AWS Config** is about tracking resource configurations and changes over time.
    - **CloudWatch vs. X-Ray:**
        - **CloudWatch** monitors performance metrics and logs.
        - **X-Ray** is used specifically for tracing the flow of requests in complex applications.
    - **Security Hub vs. Inspector:**
        - **Security Hub** aggregates and correlates security findings.
        - **Inspector** actively assesses workloads for vulnerabilities.
- **Be Skeptical:**  
    Never assume a single service covers all scenarios. Read the question carefully to identify whether the focus is on audit logs, configuration history, performance monitoring, or vulnerability assessment.
    
- **Remember the “Shared” Aspect:**  
    Some questions may even combine services (for example, using CloudTrail data within AWS Config rules or forwarding CloudWatch logs to Security Hub). Know that these services can be integrated, but each has a primary purpose.
